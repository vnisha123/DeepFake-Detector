# DeepFake-Detector

This project detects whether an image is real or fake (deepfake) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It includes a simple user interface made with Streamlit where users can upload an image and see the prediction.

- Deepfake image classification using CNN
- Streamlit web app for testing images
- Model trained on a dataset of 7000 images resized to 128x128
- Predicts in real-time if an image is "Real" or "Fake"
